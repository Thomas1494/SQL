In this project I created a few tables regarding famous singers and answered several questions about them and their relationships using Relational Queries.

CREATE TABLE singers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, stagename TEXT, age INTEGER);

INSERT INTO singers (stagename, age) VALUES ("The Weeknd", "33");
INSERT INTO singers (stagename, age) VALUES ("Bruno Mars", "37");
INSERT INTO singers (stagename, age) VALUES ("Anderson .Paak", "37");
INSERT INTO singers (stagename, age) VALUES ("Lana Del Rey", "37");
INSERT INTO singers (stagename, age) VALUES ("Rihanna", "35");
INSERT INTO singers (stagename, age) VALUES ("SZA", "33");
INSERT INTO singers (stagename, age) VALUES ("Brent Faiyaz", "27");

CREATE TABLE songs ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, singer_id INTEGER, songname TEXT);

INSERT INTO songs (singer_id, songname) VALUES (1, "The Morning");
INSERT INTO songs (singer_id, songname) VALUES (1, "Lust For Life");
INSERT INTO songs (singer_id, songname) VALUES (2, "Talking to the Moon");
INSERT INTO songs (singer_id, songname) VALUES (2,"Smokin Out The Window");
INSERT INTO songs (singer_id, songname) VALUES (3, "Love's Train");
INSERT INTO songs (singer_id, songname) VALUES (3,"Smokin Out The Window");
INSERT INTO songs (singer_id, songname) VALUES (4, "Lust For Life");
INSERT INTO songs (singer_id, songname) VALUES (5, "Rude Boy");
INSERT INTO songs (singer_id, songname) VALUES (6, "Love Galore");
INSERT INTO songs (singer_id, songname) VALUES (7, "Invite Me");

CREATE TABLE dynamic_duo (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, singer1_id INTEGER, singer2_id INTEGER);

INSERT INTO dynamic_duo (singer1_id, singer2_id) VALUES (2,3);
INSERT INTO dynamic_duo (singer1_id, singer2_id) VALUES (1,4);

SELECT s.stagename, m.songname 
FROM singers s 
JOIN songs m on s.id = m.singer_id;

SELECT a.stagename, b.stagename 
FROM dynamic_duo 
JOIN singers a 
ON a.id=dynamic_duo.singer1_id 
JOIN singers b
ON b.id = dynamic_duo.singer2_id;
